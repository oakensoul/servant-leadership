servant-leadership
==================
I'll start by saying that I love the concept of Servant Leadership. Near as I can tell, it was originally "defined" as
that term by Robert K. Greenleaf. That's not to say the concept hasn't existed for a long time. However, he spent a
great deal of time codifying the concept and putting in countless hours to share it with the rest of us in a manner that
we can truly appreciate. I would consider it a personal favor if you would read some of his work. Not only is it
inspirational, I find that it's the cornerstone of what can make us all truly excellent leaders.

While not all of the books in this repository will directly align to servant leadership, I reference them because they
have played some part in helping me along my journey.

This list is just the ones that I could remember. I have a ton more that I'll have to dig up and share. I especially
want to find the great articles and videos online to share as well.

If you actually discover this repository and find it helpful, please let me know via a GitHub issue. Please also file an
issue if you would like me to hurry up and read a particular book, add a new book, or if you just have questions.
